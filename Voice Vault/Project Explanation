Project 1: The voice vault
Goal: This project works to change text files into audio files with the help of Amazon polly invoking a trigger in Lambda. 

Steps:
> A text file is uploaded in Amazon S3. Although there are alternative methods to store the files such as 

    1. Amazon DynamoDB
          pros:       it is fast, serverless, no file handling issues
          cons:  Not ideal for long/large notes (Best when notes are short and structured)

    2. Amazon EFS(Amazon Elastic File System)
          pros: supports large files 
          cons: not beginner friendly, costs more than S3(Not recommended for low- difficulty projects)

    3. Amazon API gateway
          pros: real time processing, great for web/mobile apps
          cons: requires API design

> Two buckets are created one for input and one for output

** The region should be same for all the services used. 

> A role is created that provides access for Amazon polly, S3, Lambda execution under Lambda

AmazonS3FullAccess
AmazonPollyFullAccess
AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole

> A function is created in Lambda with the code which contains steps to search for the bucket and reach out to Amazon polly to convert text to audio. 

> A trigger is added selecting s3 as source for the input bucket.

> A text file is uploaded in the S3 input bucket and the audio file can be downloaded from the out put one.
